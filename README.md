# CS303 Updater
This script simply checks for commit updates during class.

It is helpful if you cannot make it to class for some reason, but would still like to participate in the in-class activities.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3 installed, and a bash environment to run the code in. 

Note that if your Python interpreter is utilized with a command other than ``` python3 ```, then you will have to change the line ``` python3 303script.py ``` in the file 
``` 303script.bash ``` accordingly.

Clone the repository with ``` git clone https://github.com/gaurav-karna/303_Texter ```

In the file, ``` 303script.py ``` - ensure you change ``` [phone #] ``` to the phone to which you would like to receive texts.

Navigate to the repository in the terminal, and run ``` bash 303script.bash ```, and if there is an update to the repository
during class - you will get a text at the phone number you provided.

## Improvements
I'll automate the updating of the commit even further when I have more time. It involves a commit updater when you first start the bash script.

I have also thought of using web hooks, and RSS feeds. But putting that on the back-burner for the time being.

But, for the time being - this works as a novel solution. If there any issues, open an issue and let me know :blush:
